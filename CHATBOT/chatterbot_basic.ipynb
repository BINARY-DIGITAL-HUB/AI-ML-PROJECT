      "question ===> Fileless Malware     Answere ==> Fileless Malware (FM), aka “non-malware,” or “fileless infection,” is a form of malicious computer attack that exists exclusively within the realm of volatile data storage components such as RAM, in memory processes, and service areas. This differentiates this form of malware from the classic memory-resident virus which requires some contact with non-volatile storage media, such as a hard disk drive or a thumb drive. Normally picked up following visits to malicious websites, fileless malware does not exist as a file that can be detected by standard antivirus programs. It lurks within a computer’s working memory and is exceptionally difficult to identify. However, this type of malware rarely survives a computer reboot, after which the computer should work as it did prior to infection.\n",
      "question ===> Firewall     Answere ==> A Firewall is a security system that forms a virtual perimeter around a network of workstations preventing viruses, worms, and hackers from penetrating.\n",

      "question ===> Malvertising     Answere ==> Malvertising is the use of online ads to distribute malicious programs. Cybercriminals embed a special script in a banner, or redirect users who click on an ad to a special page containing code for downloading malware. Special methods are used to bypass large ad network filters and place malicious content on trusted sites. In some cases, visitors do not even need to click on a fake ad — the code executes when the ad is displayed.\n",
      "question ===> Malware     Answere ==> Malware is a general term for any type of intrusive computer software with malicious intent against the user.\n",
      "question ===> Man-in-the Middle Attack     Answere ==> A man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) is an attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. For example, a victim believes he’s connected to his bank’s website and the flow of traffic to and from the real bank site remains unchanged, so the victim sees nothing suspicious. However, the traffic is redirected through the attacker’s site, allowing the attacker to gather any personal data entered by the victim (login, password, PIN, etc.).\n",
      "question ===> MITRE ATT&CK™ Framework     Answere ==> The MITRE ATT&CK™ framework is a comprehensive matrix of tactics and techniques used by threat hunters, red teamers, and defenders to better classify attacks and assess an organization’s risk.

      "question ===> Ransomware     Answere ==> Ransomware is the name given to malicious programs designed to extort money from victims by blocking access to the computer or encrypting stored data. The malware displays a message offering to restore the system/data in return for payment. Sometimes, cybercriminals behind the scam try to lend credibility to their operation by masquerading as law enforcement officials. Their ransom message asserts that the system has been blocked, or the data encrypted, because the victim is running unlicensed software or has accessed illegal content, and that the victim must pay a fine. Read more on Allot’s solutions for Business Security.\n",
      "question ===> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)     Answere ==> RDP is a protocol for remotely connecting to computers running Windows. It enables interaction with desktop elements as well as access to other device resources. RDP was conceived as a remote administration tool.

      "question ===> Risktool     Answere ==> Risktool programs have various functions, such as concealing files in the system, hiding the windows of running applications, or terminating active processes. They are not malicious in themselves, but include cryptocurrency miners that generate coins using the target device’s resources. Cybercriminals usually use them in stealth mode. Unlike NetTool, such programs are designed to operate locally.\n",
      "question ===> Rootkit     Answere ==> A Rootkit is a collection of software tools or a program that gives a hacker remote access to, and control over, a computer or network. Rootkits themselves do not cause direct harm – and there have been legitimate uses for this type of software, such as to provide remote end user support. However, most rootkits open a backdoor on targeted computers for the introduction of malware, viruses, and ransomware, or use the system for further network security attacks. A rootkit is typically installed through a stolen password, or by exploiting system vulnerabilities without the victim’s knowledge. In most cases, rootkits are used in conjunction with other malware to prevent detection by endpoint antivirus software.\n",
      "question ===> Sandbox(ing)     Answere ==> In cybersecurity, a sandbox is an isolated environment on a network that mimics end-user operating environments. Sandboxes are used to safely execute suspicious code without risking harm to the host device or network.\n",

      "question ===> Security Perimeter     Answere ==> A Security Perimeter is a digital boundary that is defined for a system or domain within which a specified security policy or security architecture is applied.\n",
      "question ===> SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)     Answere ==> Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a formal process by which the security of an organization is monitored and evaluated on a constant basis. SIEM helps to automatically identify systems that are out of compliance with the security policy as well as to notify the IRT (Incident Response Team) of any security-violating events.\n",
      "question ===> SIM Swapping     Answere ==> SIM Swapping is a scam used to intercept online banking SMS verification codes. To get hold of one-time passwords for financial transactions, cybercriminals create or fraudulently obtain a copy of the victim’s SIM card — for example, pretending to be the victim, the attacker might claim to have lost the SIM card and request a new one from the mobile operator. To protect clients from such schemes, most banks require that a replacement SIM card be re-linked to the account.\n",
      "question ===> Sniffing     Answere ==> Packet sniffing allows the capture of data as it is being transmitted over a network. Packet sniffer programs are used by network professionals to diagnose network issues. Malicious actors can use sniffers to capture unencrypted data like passwords and usernames in network traffic. Once this information is captured, the bad actor can then gain access to the system or network.\n",
      "question ===> SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response)     Answere ==> SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) is a solution stack of compatible software programs that organizations use to collect data about security threats from across the network and respond to low-level security events without human assistance.\n",
      "question ===> Social Engineering     Answere ==> Social Engineering is an increasingly popular method of gaining access to unauthorized resources by exploiting human psychology and manipulating users – rather than by breaking in or using technical hacking techniques. Instead of trying to find a software vulnerability in a corporate system, a social engineer might send an email to an employee pretending to be from the IT department, trying to trick him into revealing sensitive information. Social engineering is the foundation of spear phishing attacks.\n",
      "question ===> Spam     Answere ==> Spam is the name commonly given to unsolicited emails. Essentially unwanted advertising, it’s the email equivalent of physical junk mail delivered through the post.\n",
      "question ===> Spear Phishing     Answere ==> Spear Phishing is a phishing scam that targets a specific individual or organization, usually via a personalized email, SMS or other electronic communication to defraud them under the guise of a legitimate transaction.\n",
      "question ===> Spoofing     Answere ==> A Spoof is an attack attempt by an unauthorized entity or attacker to gain illegitimate access to a system by posing as an authorized user. Spoofing includes any act of disguising a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source. Spoofing can apply to emails, phone calls, and websites, or can be more technical, such as a computer spoofing an IP address.\n",
      "question ===> Spyware     Answere ==> Spyware is software that is secretly installed on a user’s device to gather sensitive data. Spyware quietly collects information such as credentials and sends it outside the network to bad actors. Spyware often comes in the form of a free download and is installed automatically, with or without user consent.\n",
      "question ===> Threat Assessment     Answere ==> Threat Assessment is a structured process used to identify and evaluate various risks or threats that an organization might be exposed to. Cyber threat assessment is a crucial part of any organization’s risk management strategy and data protection efforts.\n",

Trojan Trojans are malicious programs that perform actions that are not authorized by the user: they delete, block, modify or copy data, and they disrupt the performance of computers or computer networks. Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans are unable to make copies of themselves or self-replicate. Read more about Threat Intelligence Solutions.\n",
      "question ===> Two-factor Authentification (2FA)     Answere ==> Two-factor Authentification combines a static password with an external authentication device such as a hardware token that generates a randomly-generated one-time password, a smart card, an SMS message (where a mobile phone is the token), or a unique physical attribute like a fingerprint.\n",
      "question ===> Two-step Authentification     Answere ==> Two-step Authentification is commonly used on websites and is an improvement over single factor authentication. This form of authentication requires the visitor to provide their username (i.e. claim an identity) and password (i.e. the single factor authentication) before performing an additional step. The additional step could be receiving a text message with a code, then typing that code back into the website for confirmation. Alternatives include receiving an email and needing to click on a link in the message for confirmation, or viewing a pre-selected image and statement before typing in another password or PIN.\n",
      "question ===> Virus     Answere ==> A Virus is a malicious computer program that is often sent as an email attachment or a download with the intent of infecting that device. Once the device is infected, a virus can hijack the web browser, display unwanted ads, send spam, provide criminals with access to the device and contact list, disable security settings, scan, and find personal information like passwords.\n",
      "question ===> VPN     Answere ==> A Virtual Private Network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. It is essentially a virtual, secure corridor.\n",
      "question ===> Vulnerability     Answere ==> Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in software programs that can be exploited by hackers to compromise computers.\n",
      "question ===> WAF     Answere ==> A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a specific form of application firewall that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web service. By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attacks exploiting a web application’s known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and improper system configuration.\n",
      "question ===> White Hat – Black Hat     Answere ==> White hat – Black Hat are terms to describe the ‘good guys’ and ‘bad guys’ in the world of cybercrime. Blackhats are hackers with criminal intentions. White-hats are hackers who use their skills and talents for good and work to keep data safe from other hackers by finding system vulnerabilities that can be fixed.\n",
